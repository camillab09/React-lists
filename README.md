Ideas to improve the page:

<strike>\* Add the B-variants of the pals to the main array (cryst, ignis, lux, terra, aqua, noct)</strike>

- A popper element that reveals more info on each pal
- Update the array to include the following (with icons if possible):
  - Dropped items
  - Farmed items
  - Work abilities
- A seperate page for breeding
- A page that includes a map that shows where to find the bosses,
  what levels they are and what type (embed https://mapgenie.io/palworld/maps/palpagos-islands ?)
  <strike>- A page dedicated to cooking and recipes with abilities/ stat boosts </strike>
- A copy of the in-game technology tree with a hover effect that shows
  the materials required to build as well as needed equipment and required
  research points to unlock
- An overview of the different materials and how to aquire them
- Searchbar
